## I will record all the instructions and thought processes for the AI Agent(Claude Code) in this file.

## Goal
I want to clone the classic game ‚Äòlode runner‚Äô, the game should run in web browser, I want to choose Phaser(https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser) as the engine for this game

The project at https://github.com/quboqin/Lode-Runner-Roku provides the required soundtrack and artwork, including the game's sprites and animation. Also, the data structure for level design can be referred to. 

Deploy this game to Vercel

## Phase 1 - Planning
1. In this project, I want to use sub agents by Claude Code to replace Super Claude
>do this task manually
>```bash
>SuperClaude uninstall
>```

2. First, create a Project Manager Agent to help me manage the progress of the entire project, break down requirements and tasks, set up project Check Points, update the project progress after completing tasks, and record the progress in a progress file. Since this is a cloned project, there is no particular need for a Product Manager and a UX role. Maybe a hybrid role is needed to oversee the interface interaction and animation effects.

3. Generate the above two sub-agents according to the specifications in https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview

> Because the two prompt commands 2 and 3 were not executed together, a bunch of redundant GUIDE files were generated, which led to the optimizations in 4 and 5 later.

4. Judge whether @PROGRESS_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md and @PROJECT_STRUCTURE_PHASES.md can be combined and simplified into one file, and delete unnecessary content and files.

5. Based on the two agents under @./claude/agents, check for duplicate content in @PM_AGENT_OPERATION_GUIDE.md, @PROJECT_MANAGER_AGENT_SPEC.md, and @UI_ANIMATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md, and delete such duplicate content or files.
and check whether the two agents under @./claude/agents are using @PROJECT_PROGRESS.md reasonably

6. Because I have utilized the capabilities of AI, I want to optimize the R & D progress within one week. 

7. Replan. I don't want to reduce functionality.

8. I'm not sure you can do these things in parallel and achieve them step by step within 9 days.

9. Do you need to update @./claude/agents

> ‰∏Ä‰∏™AI AgentËøòÁÖûÊúâ‰ªã‰∫ãÁöÑÁªôÊàëÂÆâÊéí‰∫Ü‰∏Ä‰∏™38Â§©ÁöÑËÆ°ÂàíÔºÅ
> An AI Agent even seriously arranged a 38 - day plan for me!

10. add an .gitignore file, and rm @.claude/settings.local.json from
   repository

## Day 1

11. Let's start the development tasks for the first day.

12. Encountered
```
API Error: 500 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"api_error","me
    ssage":"Internal server error"}}
```
try again

13. Submit a version of the code first, but don't push it. Wait for my subsequent instructions. The tasks of Day 1 are not completed. I need to check. 
![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 8.12.32‚ÄØPM.png>)

14. /add-dir /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode-Runner-Roku     
Replace the resources of the current project with the assets in /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode-Runner-Roku. Use the resources in IBM
![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 8.43.13‚ÄØPM.png>)
commit this replace, but the Day 1 tasks are still not finished, let me verify 

15. @screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 8.43.13‚ÄØPM.png and @james-halliday.md are not be 
  committed
16. You've misunderstood. I meant for you to withdraw the previous submission and also submit the modifications to these two files.

17. When I deployed this project on Vercel, I wanted to start a new game, but when I pressed `enter`, it was no response. but when I run on my local host, it is ok

18. According to the console logs, I've seen these errors, so the previous solution was incorrect. Is it possible to roll back, re - locate the problem as shown in the screenshot, but don't commit or push for now.![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 9.28.44‚ÄØAM.png>)

19. It's still incorrect. This time the error is![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 9.41.03‚ÄØAM.png>)

20. ‰ªé17-19Ôºå ÊàëÂèëÁé∞‰Ω†Èô∑Âú®VercelÁöÑÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ÈóÆÈ¢òÈáå‰∫ÜÔºåÁõÆÂâçÁöÑËß£ÂÜ≥ÊêûÈîô‰∫ÜÊñπÂêëÔºå ËØ∑ÂÖàÂõûÊªöÂà∞1d3f6c2ËøôÊ¨°Êèê‰∫§. ÊàëÂÖàcheckÂÖ∂‰ªñÈóÆÈ¢ò 

I found that you are stuck in the Vercel deployment issue. The current solution is going in the wrong direction. Please roll back to the commit 1d3f6c2 first. I'll first check for other problems

> @james-halliday.md cannot be used as a file name. This name has been preemptively registered by a little bear. Change the file name to @uncle-bob.md

21. Bug fix
  1. ![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 12.11.35‚ÄØPM.png>) pressed `space`, but it does not return to the main menu, figout the issue, don't commit and don't push
  2. When I enter into a new game, and press `ESC`, it also can not return to the main menu...... still doesn't work
  ![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 12.27.59‚ÄØPM.png>)
  3. The number of animation frames hard-coded in AssetManager.ts is incorrect, and it's also inappropriate to hard-code them in the code. Please refer to the implementation of defining animations in JSON format in assets/anims/ in /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode - Runner - Roku.
    1. No need for fallback animations
    2. In /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode-Runner-Roku  The enemy sprites is called `Guard`, replace all `enemy` with `guard`

22. Vercel Deploy
create a new branch for vercel deployment
according to the specifications in https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview add a new sub-agent for deploying on Vercel

The project of Phaser built by Vite runs normally locally. However, when deployed to Vercel, the resources cannot be read. May I ask what issues are mainly causing this? Check the entire project and, from the perspective of a vercel-deployment-specialist, see where modifications are needed. 

commit and push this branch, I plan to test whether the deployment on Vercel is successful by myself

I want to trigger Vercel to deploy this branch. What configurations do I need to make? Please give me detailed instructions. Only one method is required, and it is better to support the command line.

**Deployment Guide**: See [vercel-deployment-guide.md](./vercel-deployment-guide.md) for complete CLI deployment instructions.

23. commit, and merge this branch into main, then switch to main branch

24. As a project manager, check the status of this project, and update progress of this project
I think we've only completed most of the work for Day 1 - 2 and Day 3 - 4. The 'Build level geometry collision system' hasn't started yet, and many subsequent tasks can't be considered completed either. As a senior PM üêª, please think hard and carefully update the project progress.
Day 8 and Day 9 are also not completed yet

25. create a folder named screenshots, and move all screenshot files(file names starting with Screenshot 2025-08-) into this folder, and update all links in uncle-bob.md file

## Day 2
26. create a feature branch for implement collision detection

27. <a id="bug2">stuck here againüò©</a>let's start with the four critical features in current sprint
yes, after finishing each feature, don't commit code, let me check first

  Two problems
  1. The roof is too low, or the Player and Guard are too tall. When walking left or right, their heads hit the roof and they can't pass through.
  2. It's incorrect that one can move up and down without a ladder.
  ![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-06 at 11.28.02‚ÄØAM.png>)

  > Add a rule to the memory. Every time you finish modifying a feature, confirm with me first and don't submit the code immediately.
  3. When the game starts, the PLAYER doesn't fall to the ground and remains floating in the air.
  ![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-06 at 11.40.18‚ÄØAM.png>)

You said that the Player is on the ground(or standing on a solid surface), but from the screenshot![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-06 at 3.11.36‚ÄØPM.png>), There is still a gap between the player and the ground. Should the y-axis direction also be adjusted after the size of the Player is reduced?

Is it possible to mark the actual size of the Player, the enlarged size, the collision range, and the Offset on the Sprite with different colors to help me identify the problem?

Press 'D' for the first time to display the Player. Press 'D' again to overlay the Body. Press 'D' once more to remove all Debug information.

Draw the dimensions and coordinate relationships of the Player's Sprite and Body in markdown format according to the Phaser documentation and the settings in GameScene.ts
Output it as a separate Markdown file

you set the size of body is
playerBody.setSize(16, 28);
but I dump the size on the screen 
Body Size: ${playerBody.width} x ${playerBody.height}
![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-06 at 8.46.21‚ÄØPM.png>)
width is 25.6, height is 44.8
Where was this value changed?

Change it back so that pressing 'D' once will display the coordinate information of all Sprites and Bodies, and the Position of the Body will also display the coordinates of the center point for easy understanding.
![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-07 at 9.24.37‚ÄØAM.png>)
Is the value of playerBody.setOffset(8, 4) also affected by the scale of 1.6? If so, please correct it.

28. remove the PLAYER_DIMENSIONS.md file, commit all changes

add 4 screenshots, change CLAUDE.md and uncle-bob.md file, please amend last commit, and commit again

push this branch to github

## Day 3
29. Create a sub - agent according to the guidelines in the document https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents to assist me in doing a good job in testing. This tester should have in - depth knowledge of the [Phaser architecture](https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser) and be able to solve problems like [27](#bug2). Additionally, install mcp or tools that can debug or test web apps, enabling this agent to automatically test the problems encountered by the web app.

I need to install those Chrome plugins and MCP Tools under Claude Code to support the automated UI testing. Provide detailed installation and configuration steps. Also, provide the testing flow to guide the test agent. 

I've checked the plan 'Install MCP Tools and Chrome Extensions for Automated UI Testing'. There are several points that need to be adjusted:
1. Simplify 1.1. There's no need for too many options. I prefer Option 2.
2. If Puppeteer is not necessary, please remove it.
3. For 2.1, please explain the steps and configurations in more detail. Where should the Chrome DevTools extensions for debugging be installed? And it's not the same as the DevTools browser extension for Vue.js that I've already installed, right? How to configure `Configure headless mode for CI/CD`? Is this necessary in the testing? If not, please remove it for now.
4. Regarding the content mentioned in 2.2, is it necessary to install?
5. Don't consider 4.3 Continuous Integration for now.
6. Output the above steps as a Markdown document and configure it well. If there are any manual operations required during the configuration process, please remind me. Don't start the testing for now. After ensuring that the environment is okay, start the testing of 4.1 and 4.2.

There are several questions.
1. Is it a choice between Chromium browser and Chrome + Phaser Debug Tool?
2. If it is a choice between the two, please check the current configuration and find out which one is in use.
3. What is the relationship between Playwright and these two?
4. Are 'Phaser Debug Tool' and 'Phaser Debugger' the same thing? Confirm and help me update TESTING_SETUP.md.

I have confirmed the environment. Please execute Phase 6 and conduct automated testing.

I want to know where the `runAutomatedTests` is triggered and called? There is an explicit call in `run - automated - tests.js`. Is it only triggered from this place? How is this function passed to the mcp server? Then the mcp server launches chromium. How are the results returned, and to whom? How to check the results? I want to know the entire process.

Are runAutomatedTests and executeWithPlaywright independent of each other?

> !!! A bunch of configuration issues were caused by the version problem of Chromium. ...... After going through a lot of trouble, it was only effective to install Playwright in the project. However, the MCP test has not started yet.

## Day 4
30. Add ladder and rope climbing mechanics
As a senior Phaser architect (https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser), it's time to start developing the core game logic. After reviewing the existing implementation in the @GameScene.ts file, please think deeply.
1. First, implement the movement logic on the ladder.
   1. The character can move up and down on the ladder.
   2. When there is no key pressed, the gravity is 0 at this time. With the support of the ladder, the Player remains stationary.  

The function is incorrect. The player is on the ladder and the gravity is 0, but the player slides down automatically without pressing any keys.

The problem still hasn't been solved. I think the parameters are all correct. ![Screenshot on the ladder 1](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-08 at 10.41.39‚ÄØAM.png>). First, add the modifications to GameScene.ts to the git stage, but don't commit. Think Harder and find out the reason.

  1. Does the sliding stop when on the ladder? No
  2. What does "Moving Despite 0 Velocity" show? 
  3. What are the Position Delta values when stationary on ladder?
  4. Do you see console messages about blocking collisions? Yes

  ![Screenshot on the ladder 2](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-08 at 11.34.14‚ÄØAM.png>)

Body Moves Enabled: üîí LOCKED. The player can now stop on the ladder, but cannot move left or right. I think you may have found the problem, but this solution will cause the problem of not being able to move left or right.

Maybe you've indeed found the problem. Could you summarize the cause of the problem by combining with the Phaser architectureÔºü Output it as a separate Markdown file
> [LADDER_SLIDING_TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS](LADDER_SLIDING_TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md)

31. I've found another problem. The Player can't stand on the top rung of the ladder. I need to keep pressing the up arrow key to stay in the top position.

32. The Player can't grab the rope, but can stay in the air. After I move left or right, the Y - direction value increases, and then the Player moves downward. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior when moving left or right on the rope.

It is hard to take a snapshot, but I saw that 
```
Position Delta: (0.00, 0.22)
```
Other values are correct
- ‚úÖ Velocity: `(0.0, 0.0)` - Correct
- ‚úÖ Acceleration: `(0.0, 0.0)` - Correct  
- ‚úÖ Gravity: `0` - Correct
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Position Delta: `(0.00, 0.22)` - **Player moving despite zero forces**
But the problem is still excited.
The value of Y is from 
Y=376.089 to Y=377.644

When on the rope, there should be no up - and - down movement, and the corresponding animation is also incorrect. When moving left and right on the Rope, use the bar animation in runner.json
And the value of Y should be loocked, But when I move left and right.

It is incorrect that BRICK or SOLID beside the ladder can be penetrated.

When standing at the top of the Ladder and overlapping with the Rope, the state should switch to the Rope state.

On the rope, one can go down, that is, jump down.

Look at this picture. The state is on the Rope, but the Y value is still too low, resulting in an inability to move left. There is still a gap between the Player and the Rope.
Y position is still too low![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-08 at 2.27.50‚ÄØPM.png>)

When passing by the top of the ladder, the player will drop a little bit. The player should be standing on it instead of dropping. On the rope, the player should be able to press the down arrow key to jump down.

On the top of the Ladder, I can't move down. Please consider the logic carefully.

  1. Are you able to move left/right at this position? Yes
  2. If you jump (if there's a jump key), do you fall down?
  3. What happens if you move left or right - do you eventually fall
  fall?

‚è∫ Perfect! Now the collision logic is fixed. The key change is
  that when you press the down arrow key while standing above a
  ladder tile, it will allow you to pass through and start
  climbing down, rather than being blocked by the collision.


>  What this fix does:
>  1. When you press DOWN: You can now pass through the ladder tile
>   collision and start climbing
>  2. When moving up: Pass-through continues to work as before
>  3. When climbing: Prevents getting stuck in climbing states
>
>  Now when you're at that position where you were stuck, pressing
>  the down arrow should allow you to drop down onto the ladder
>  tile below and start climbing down!  

33. Create hole digging mechanics 
The hole should be filled after a period of time and turn back into the original brick.
It has no effect. There is no regeneration. Please think harder to fix this issue.

the time of regeneration is too long
I think it was 1 second before. Check the reason why it takes so long. Are there any other problems?

When the Player passes through the Hole, there is a black obstruction below Visually.

If there is something else below the Hole, such as a Rope, the Rope becomes invisible, but it is indeed there.

## Day 5
34. gold collection
The rule is 
1. hide the exit ladder first
2. after finishing collecting all gold, then show the exit ladder
3. when the play arrives at the top of the exit ladder, the player archive the level successfully

In the map(classic.json), the 'S' stands for the exit ladder, please hide the exit ladder first

You have detected the exit ladder, but don't show the exit ladder the the level starts 

The problem still hasn't been solved. The exit ladder can be seen after the game is initialized. Please think more deeply.

The hidden exit ladders are behaviorally equivalent to empty tiles and are equivalent to ladders when they appear.

When the exit ladder appears, I think you regard it as an obstacle. I can't pass through this ladder, let alone climb up it.

When i arrived at the top of the exit ladder, the level does not finish

When the exit ladder appears, the topmost exit ladder is flashing

When the level is finished, please load the next level

I have fixed the level loading issue by myself

35. Solid blocks(@) should use different sprite, and can't be digged 

36. update the progres of the project, and finish all tasks of day 7

Don't update the progress. I haven't passed the test yet. I found that the Guard didn't take any action at all.

When the player enters this level again after being caught, the guard doesn't react.

the live of the player is not decrease after it was caught     

The logic should be:
1. When the player is caught, the live should be decreased by 1 and the level should restart. But now, it goes back to the main menu. When entering again, the live becomes 3.

2. If the guard passes through the hole completely before the hole is sealed, it doesn't have to die.

3. The guard should either dash through the ladder or go up and down the ladder. Now I find that the guard gets stuck on the ladder. It seems that the guard can't use the rope either.

This time, it's not about removing the debug console. The problem still hasn't been solved. The guard can't get past the ladder when it encounters it.

The problem still hasn't been solved. Think harder.

Now the guard can pass through the ladder, but when coming down from the ladder, it doesn't seem to climb down, but rather fall down.

There is also too much and too rapid console log output, and I can't provide useful information.

When the Player digs a Hole, the Guard should still chase in the direction of the Player. And I found that even after the Hole disappears, the Guard doesn't chase, as if it can't pass through the original disappearing position.

When both the Guard and the Player can fall out of the game from the Hole (the bottom layer), this is incorrect. They should not be able to fall out of the game on this bottom layer.

There is a problem with the last modification. It should still be possible to dig holes on the bottommost layer, and one can also fall into the holes. However, it is not allowed to jump out to the area below the bottommost layer. The area below the bottommost layer should be regarded as an obstacle. 

It's a logical problem. I can't enter the game and can't start the game.

The problem hasn't been solved, and the Guard can still fall out of the game from the right side.

If there is enough time, the Guard can climb out before the Hole disappears.
If there is not enough time, the Guard will be killed, but will respawn at his initial position.

When the Guard climbs the ladder, the x - position should snap to the middle of the ladder, otherwise it won't be able to climb up.

The Player can step on the Guard's head to pass through. As long as they are not on the same horizontal plane, it is not considered being caught.

If the Guard and the Player are not on the same horizontal plane (possibly below the Player), they will not look for a ladder to climb up. There might be a problem with the AI's logic here.

The positions of the Guards should not overlap.
