## I will record all the instructions and thought processes for the AI Agent(Claude Code) in this file.

## Goal
I want to clone the classic game ‘lode runner’, the game should run in web browser, I want to choose Phaser(https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser) as the engine for this game

The project at https://github.com/quboqin/Lode-Runner-Roku provides the required soundtrack and artwork, including the game's sprites and animation. Also, the data structure for level design can be referred to. 

Deploy this game to Vercel

## Phase 1 - Planning
1. In this project, I want to use sub agents by Claude Code to replace Super Claude
>do this task manually
>```bash
>SuperClaude uninstall
>```

2. First, create a Project Manager Agent to help me manage the progress of the entire project, break down requirements and tasks, set up project Check Points, update the project progress after completing tasks, and record the progress in a progress file. Since this is a cloned project, there is no particular need for a Product Manager and a UX role. Maybe a hybrid role is needed to oversee the interface interaction and animation effects.

3. Generate the above two sub-agents according to the specifications in https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview

> Because the two prompt commands 2 and 3 were not executed together, a bunch of redundant GUIDE files were generated, which led to the optimizations in 4 and 5 later.

4. Judge whether @PROGRESS_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md and @PROJECT_STRUCTURE_PHASES.md can be combined and simplified into one file, and delete unnecessary content and files.

5. Based on the two agents under @./claude/agents, check for duplicate content in @PM_AGENT_OPERATION_GUIDE.md, @PROJECT_MANAGER_AGENT_SPEC.md, and @UI_ANIMATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md, and delete such duplicate content or files.
and check whether the two agents under @./claude/agents are using @PROJECT_PROGRESS.md reasonably

6. Because I have utilized the capabilities of AI, I want to optimize the R & D progress within one week. 

7. Replan. I don't want to reduce functionality.

8. I'm not sure you can do these things in parallel and achieve them step by step within 9 days.

9. Do you need to update @./claude/agents

> 一个AI Agent还煞有介事的给我安排了一个38天的计划！
> An AI Agent even seriously arranged a 38 - day plan for me!

10. add an .gitignore file, and rm @.claude/settings.local.json from
   repository

## Day 1

11. Let's start the development tasks for the first day.

12. Encountered
```
API Error: 500 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"api_error","me
    ssage":"Internal server error"}}
```
try again

13. Submit a version of the code first, but don't push it. Wait for my subsequent instructions. The tasks of Day 1 are not completed. I need to check.

14. /add-dir /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode-Runner-Roku     
Replace the resources of the current project with the assets in /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode-Runner-Roku. Use the resources in IBM
![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 8.43.13 PM.png>)
commit this replace, but the Day 1 tasks are still not finished, let me verify 

15. @Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 8.43.13 PM.png and @james-halliday.md are not be 
  committed
16. You've misunderstood. I meant for you to withdraw the previous submission and also submit the modifications to these two files.

17. When I deployed this project on Vercel, I wanted to start a new game, but when I pressed `enter`, it was no response. but when I run on my local host, it is ok

18. According to the console logs, I've seen these errors, so the previous solution was incorrect. Is it possible to roll back, re - locate the problem as shown in the screenshot, but don't commit or push for now.![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 9.28.44 AM.png>)

19. It's still incorrect. This time the error is![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 9.41.03 AM.png>)

20. 从17-19， 我发现你陷在Vercel的部署问题里了，目前的解决搞错了方向， 请先回滚到1d3f6c2这次提交. 我先check其他问题 

I found that you are stuck in the Vercel deployment issue. The current solution is going in the wrong direction. Please roll back to the commit 1d3f6c2 first. I'll first check for other problems

> @james-halliday.md cannot be used as a file name. This name has been preemptively registered by a little bear. Change the file name to @uncle-bob.md

21. Bug fix
  1. ![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 12.11.35 PM.png>) pressed `space`, but it does not return to the main menu, figout the issue, don't commit and don't push
  2. When I enter into a new game, and press `ESC`, it also can not return to the main menu...... still doesn't work
  ![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 12.27.59 PM.png>)
  3. The number of animation frames hard-coded in AssetManager.ts is incorrect, and it's also inappropriate to hard-code them in the code. Please refer to the implementation of defining animations in JSON format in assets/anims/ in /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode - Runner - Roku.
    1. No need for fallback animations
    2. In /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode-Runner-Roku  The enemy sprites is called `Guard`, replace all `enemy` with `guard`

22. Vercel Deploy
create a new branch for vercel deployment
according to the specifications in https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview add a new sub-agent for deploying on Vercel

The project of Phaser built by Vite runs normally locally. However, when deployed to Vercel, the resources cannot be read. May I ask what issues are mainly causing this? Check the entire project and, from the perspective of a vercel-deployment-specialist, see where modifications are needed. 

commit and push this branch, I plan to test whether the deployment on Vercel is successful by myself
