## I will record all the instructions and thought processes for the AI Agent(Claude Code) in this file.

## Goal
I want to clone the classic game ‚Äòlode runner‚Äô, the game should run in web browser, I want to choose Phaser(https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser) as the engine for this game

The project at https://github.com/quboqin/Lode-Runner-Roku provides the required soundtrack and artwork, including the game's sprites and animation. Also, the data structure for level design can be referred to. 

Deploy this game to Vercel

## Phase 1 - Planning
1. In this project, I want to use sub agents by Claude Code to replace Super Claude
>do this task manually
>```bash
>SuperClaude uninstall
>```

2. First, create a Project Manager Agent to help me manage the progress of the entire project, break down requirements and tasks, set up project Check Points, update the project progress after completing tasks, and record the progress in a progress file. Since this is a cloned project, there is no particular need for a Product Manager and a UX role. Maybe a hybrid role is needed to oversee the interface interaction and animation effects.

3. Generate the above two sub-agents according to the specifications in https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview

> Because the two prompt commands 2 and 3 were not executed together, a bunch of redundant GUIDE files were generated, which led to the optimizations in 4 and 5 later.

4. Judge whether @PROGRESS_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md and @PROJECT_STRUCTURE_PHASES.md can be combined and simplified into one file, and delete unnecessary content and files.

5. Based on the two agents under @./claude/agents, check for duplicate content in @PM_AGENT_OPERATION_GUIDE.md, @PROJECT_MANAGER_AGENT_SPEC.md, and @UI_ANIMATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md, and delete such duplicate content or files.
and check whether the two agents under @./claude/agents are using @PROJECT_PROGRESS.md reasonably

6. Because I have utilized the capabilities of AI, I want to optimize the R & D progress within one week. 

7. Replan. I don't want to reduce functionality.

8. I'm not sure you can do these things in parallel and achieve them step by step within 9 days.

9. Do you need to update @./claude/agents

> ‰∏Ä‰∏™AI AgentËøòÁÖûÊúâ‰ªã‰∫ãÁöÑÁªôÊàëÂÆâÊéí‰∫Ü‰∏Ä‰∏™38Â§©ÁöÑËÆ°ÂàíÔºÅ
> An AI Agent even seriously arranged a 38 - day plan for me!

10. add an .gitignore file, and rm @.claude/settings.local.json from
   repository

## Day 1

11. Let's start the development tasks for the first day.

12. Encountered
```
API Error: 500 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"api_error","me
    ssage":"Internal server error"}}
```
try again

13. Submit a version of the code first, but don't push it. Wait for my subsequent instructions. The tasks of Day 1 are not completed. I need to check.

14. /add-dir /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode-Runner-Roku     
Replace the resources of the current project with the assets in /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode-Runner-Roku. Use the resources in IBM
![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 8.43.13‚ÄØPM.png>)
commit this replace, but the Day 1 tasks are still not finished, let me verify 

15. @screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 8.43.13‚ÄØPM.png and @james-halliday.md are not be 
  committed
16. You've misunderstood. I meant for you to withdraw the previous submission and also submit the modifications to these two files.

17. When I deployed this project on Vercel, I wanted to start a new game, but when I pressed `enter`, it was no response. but when I run on my local host, it is ok

18. According to the console logs, I've seen these errors, so the previous solution was incorrect. Is it possible to roll back, re - locate the problem as shown in the screenshot, but don't commit or push for now.![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 9.28.44‚ÄØAM.png>)

19. It's still incorrect. This time the error is![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 9.41.03‚ÄØAM.png>)

20. ‰ªé17-19Ôºå ÊàëÂèëÁé∞‰Ω†Èô∑Âú®VercelÁöÑÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ÈóÆÈ¢òÈáå‰∫ÜÔºåÁõÆÂâçÁöÑËß£ÂÜ≥ÊêûÈîô‰∫ÜÊñπÂêëÔºå ËØ∑ÂÖàÂõûÊªöÂà∞1d3f6c2ËøôÊ¨°Êèê‰∫§. ÊàëÂÖàcheckÂÖ∂‰ªñÈóÆÈ¢ò 

I found that you are stuck in the Vercel deployment issue. The current solution is going in the wrong direction. Please roll back to the commit 1d3f6c2 first. I'll first check for other problems

> @james-halliday.md cannot be used as a file name. This name has been preemptively registered by a little bear. Change the file name to @uncle-bob.md

21. Bug fix
  1. ![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 12.11.35‚ÄØPM.png>) pressed `space`, but it does not return to the main menu, figout the issue, don't commit and don't push
  2. When I enter into a new game, and press `ESC`, it also can not return to the main menu...... still doesn't work
  ![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 12.27.59‚ÄØPM.png>)
  3. The number of animation frames hard-coded in AssetManager.ts is incorrect, and it's also inappropriate to hard-code them in the code. Please refer to the implementation of defining animations in JSON format in assets/anims/ in /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode - Runner - Roku.
    1. No need for fallback animations
    2. In /Users/qinqubo/magic/refs/Lode-Runner-Roku  The enemy sprites is called `Guard`, replace all `enemy` with `guard`

22. Vercel Deploy
create a new branch for vercel deployment
according to the specifications in https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview add a new sub-agent for deploying on Vercel

The project of Phaser built by Vite runs normally locally. However, when deployed to Vercel, the resources cannot be read. May I ask what issues are mainly causing this? Check the entire project and, from the perspective of a vercel-deployment-specialist, see where modifications are needed. 

commit and push this branch, I plan to test whether the deployment on Vercel is successful by myself

I want to trigger Vercel to deploy this branch. What configurations do I need to make? Please give me detailed instructions. Only one method is required, and it is better to support the command line.

**Deployment Guide**: See [vercel-deployment-guide.md](./vercel-deployment-guide.md) for complete CLI deployment instructions.

23. commit, and merge this branch into main, then switch to main branch

24. As a project manager, check the status of this project, and update progress of this project
I think we've only completed most of the work for Day 1 - 2 and Day 3 - 4. The 'Build level geometry collision system' hasn't started yet, and many subsequent tasks can't be considered completed either. As a senior PM üêª, please think hard and carefully update the project progress.
Day 8 and Day 9 are also not completed yet

25. create a folder named screenshots, and move all screenshot files(file names starting with Screenshot 2025-08-) into this folder, and update all links in uncle-bob.md file

## Day 2
26. create a feature branch for implement collision detection

27. let's start with the four critical features in current sprint
yes, after finishing each feature, don't commit code, let me check first

  Two problems
  1. The roof is too low, or the Player and Guard are too tall. When walking left or right, their heads hit the roof and they can't pass through.
  2. It's incorrect that one can move up and down without a ladder.
  ![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-06 at 11.28.02‚ÄØAM.png>)

  > Add a rule to the memory. Every time you finish modifying a feature, confirm with me first and don't submit the code immediately.
  3. When the game starts, the PLAYER doesn't fall to the ground and remains floating in the air.
  ![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-06 at 11.40.18‚ÄØAM.png>)

You said that the Player is on the ground(or standing on a solid surface), but from the screenshot![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-06 at 3.11.36‚ÄØPM.png>), There is still a gap between the player and the ground. Should the y-axis direction also be adjusted after the size of the Player is reduced?



Is it possible to mark the actual size of the Player, the enlarged size, the collision range, and the Offset on the Sprite with different colors to help me identify the problem?

Press 'D' for the first time to display the Player. Press 'D' again to overlay the Body. Press 'D' once more to remove all Debug information.

Draw the dimensions and coordinate relationships of the Player's Sprite and Body in markdown format according to the Phaser documentation and the settings in GameScene.ts
Output it as a separate Markdown file

you set the size of body is
playerBody.setSize(16, 28);
but I dump the size on the screen 
Body Size: ${playerBody.width} x ${playerBody.height}
![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-06 at 8.46.21‚ÄØPM.png>)
width is 25.6, height is 44.8
Where was this value changed?

Change it back so that pressing 'D' once will display the coordinate information of all Sprites and Bodies, and the Position of the Body will also display the coordinates of the center point for easy understanding.

Is the value of playerBody.setOffset(8, 4) also affected by the scale of 1.6? If so, please correct it.

28. remove the PLAYER_DIMENSIONS.md file, commit all changes

add 4 screenshots, change CLAUDE.md and uncle-bob.md file, please amend last commit, and commit again
