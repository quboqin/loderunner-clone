## I will record all the instructions and thought processes for the AI Agent(Claude Code) in this file.

## Goal
I want to clone the classic game ‘lode runner’, the game should run in web browser, I want to choose Phaser(https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser) as the engine for this game

The project at https://github.com/quboqin/Lode-Runner-Roku provides the required soundtrack and artwork, including the game's sprites and animation. Also, the data structure for level design can be referred to. 

## Phase 1 - Planning
