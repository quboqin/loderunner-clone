## ü§ñ DAY 7: GUARD AI IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Core Guard AI Features Required

#### 1. Guard Sprite System (4h estimated)
- **Guard Animation States**: idle, running_left, running_right, climbing_up, climbing_down, falling
- **Sprite Integration**: Use existing animation framework (similar to player animations)
- **Visual Consistency**: Ensure guards match game's visual style and depth hierarchy
- **Animation Timing**: Smooth 8-10 FPS animation cycles for natural movement

#### 2. Basic Guard Movement AI (6h estimated)
- **Physics Integration**: Use existing collision system for guard movement constraints
- **Ground Detection**: Guards stay on platforms, detect edges and obstacles
- **Ladder/Rope Climbing**: Guards can navigate ladders and ropes (simplified vs player)
- **Movement Speed**: Consistent speed slower than player (allows escape strategies)

#### 3. Guard Pathfinding System (4h estimated)
- **Simple AI Logic**: Basic left/right patrolling with obstacle avoidance
- **Platform Navigation**: Guards reverse direction at platform edges
- **Vertical Navigation**: Guards climb ladders/ropes to pursue player or continue patrol
- **Stuck Detection**: Guards recover from stuck states (trapped in holes, dead ends)

#### 4. Guard-Player Collision (3h estimated)
- **Death Detection**: Guard touching player triggers game over
- **Collision Boundaries**: Use existing collision system for precise detection
- **Game Over Integration**: Connect to existing game over/restart mechanisms
- **Fair Collision**: Clear visual indication before death collision

#### 5. Guard Spawning & Level Integration (2h estimated)
- **Level Data Integration**: Use existing level data structure for guard placement
- **Dynamic Spawning**: Guards spawn at designated points in level
- **Multiple Guards**: Support 2-3 guards per level with individual AI
- **Respawn Logic**: Guards respawn after falling into holes (with delay)

### Guard AI Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Basic Guard Entity (Day 7 Start)
1. Create Guard class extending existing game object patterns
2. Implement basic sprite animations using existing asset system
3. Add basic physics (gravity, collision boundaries) using existing collision system
4. Test guard rendering and basic movement in level

#### Phase 2: Movement & Pathfinding (Day 7 Mid)
1. Implement basic left/right patrolling behavior
2. Add platform edge detection using existing collision system
3. Implement ladder/rope climbing navigation
4. Add stuck detection and recovery mechanisms

#### Phase 3: Player Interaction (Day 7 End)
1. Implement guard-player collision detection
2. Connect collision to game over system
3. Test and balance guard behavior and difficulty
4. Add guard trap mechanics (falling into holes)

### Success Criteria for Day 7
- **Working Guard Animations**: All guard movement states animate smoothly
- **Intelligent Movement**: Guards navigate levels without getting permanently stuck
- **Player Challenge**: Guards provide appropriate gameplay challenge without being overpowered
- **Collision Integration**: Guard-player collision works reliably with existing systems
- **Level Integration**: Guards spawn correctly and patrol effectively in game levels

### Technical Implementation Notes
- **Leverage Existing Systems**: Use established collision, animation, and physics frameworks
- **Code Reuse**: Follow player implementation patterns for consistency
- **Performance**: Ensure multiple guards don't impact frame rate
- **Debugging**: Extend existing debug system (J key) to visualize guard AI states

This completes the Guard AI implementation roadmap using the solid foundation of existing game mechanics.
